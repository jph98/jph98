## How I work

I'm a hands on CTO, I work with code, design, architecture - whatever is required.  I started off as a backend engineer with Java systems originally, then Ruby, Python and Javascript.  I mostly these days build out systems on Python and Javascript and apps on React and React Native.  Principles I follow:

- ❤️ Get stuff done, collaborate and make peoples lives easier.
- ❤️ Always think with your product hat on, the OMTM and supporting the business
- ❤️ Always think and do some design up-front, but always be coding
- ❤️ Always think about the operational aspects of software and system qualities - don't throw crap into production
- ❤️ Building to learn is fine, but don't make your prototype production
- 💀 Don't overcomplicate things
- 💀 Don't build cathedrals when bazaars are good enough
- 💀 Don't build stuff you don't need to when you can integrate and re-use
